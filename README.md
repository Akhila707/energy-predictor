# âš¡ Energy Predictor API

This project provides an API for predicting energy consumption using a trained Random Forest Regression model. Built using Flask, the API accepts JSON input and returns predictions.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Predicts energy output based on input features.
- Simple RESTful interface.
- Lightweight and easy to deploy.

## ðŸ§  Model
The model is trained using the Random Forest Regressor from `scikit-learn`. It is serialized using `joblib`.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
